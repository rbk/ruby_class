# Create a class called RestartMonitor that 
# can read from the attached log file and report 
# the dates and times that system restarts occurred.

# Your RestartMonitor class should have 
# the ability to work with any specified 
# log file name, it should be able to search 
# for system restarts and report on those 
# restarts independently (i.e. searching 
# for and showing the restarts do not have 
# to happen at the same time), and duplicate 
# restarts should not be shown.

# Restarts can be identified in the log file 
# by the word "restarting" that will occur in those lines.
